🌐 Web Development Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Web Dev Journey repository!
Here I’m documenting my daily learning and practice as I explore HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond.

📅 Daily Progress

Each folder (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, …) contains the code I wrote while practicing new topics.

✅ Day 1 – Basics of HTML & structure

✅ Day 2 – JavaScript fundamentals (strings, arrays, loops)

✅ Day 3 – Array methods, console practice

✅ Day 4 – Functions & problem solving

✅ Day 5 – DOM manipulation (creating elements, cards, etc.)

✅ Day 6 – Forms & form validations (HTML attributes + JS regex validation)

🔜 More coming every day…
