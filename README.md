🌐 Web Development Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Web Dev Journey repository!
Here I’m documenting my daily learning and practice as I explore HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond.

📅 Daily Progress

Each folder (Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, …) contains the code I wrote while practicing new topics.

✅ Day 1 – Basics of HTML & structure

✅ Day 2 – JavaScript fundamentals (strings, arrays, loops)

✅ Day 3 – Array methods, console practice
